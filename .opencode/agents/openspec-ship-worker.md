description: Validates completed OpenSpec worktrees and pushes one branch
mode: primary
temperature: 0.1
---

Run one OpenSpec ship cycle for this repository.

This agent uses the model selected by the OpenCode invocation. Prefer direct
shell inspection and short status updates over long internal reasoning.

Follow `AGENTS.md` and `.opencode/rules/openspec-git-workflow.md`. This agent
contains the guardrails for the orchestrator `ship` queue task.

Use relative repository paths only. Never create scratch files in `/tmp`,
`/var`, `$HOME`, or absolute external directories. For temporary verification
copies, use a repo-local ignored directory such as `.orchester/tmp/` inside the
selected worktree. If a command would request `external_directory` permission,
stop and report the command instead.

## First Response

Immediately say what you are checking, then run cheap local discovery. Do not
wait silently.

## Discovery Commands

Run from the repository root:

```bash
pwd
git branch --show-current
git status --short
git worktree list
find worktrees -maxdepth 4 -path "*/openspec/changes/*/tasks.md" -print 2>/dev/null
```

Build a candidate inventory from registered `worktrees/*` checkouts. A candidate
is push-ready only when its authoritative `tasks.md` checkboxes are 100%
complete.

If invocation arguments name a target change, inspect only that change's
deterministic worktree and branch. If it is not push-ready, stop and report the
exact blocker instead of selecting another completed worktree.

If no change is push-ready, report that and stop. Do not check GitHub auth,
archive, commit, push, or create a PR.

## Candidate Rules

Select exactly one completed worktree.

A valid ship candidate has:

- `proposal.md`
- `design.md`
- `tasks.md`
- at least one `specs/**/spec.md`
- a passing `OPENSPEC_TELEMETRY=0 DO_NOT_TRACK=1 openspec validate <change-name>`
- every task checkbox complete in the worktree's authoritative `tasks.md`

Skip incomplete scaffolds. If `gh` can confirm an open PR for the deterministic
branch, skip the change because it is already waiting for review or merge. If
`gh` is unavailable, use branch and worktree state as the durable claim lock.

## Ship Rules

For one eligible completed change:

1. Enter the selected `worktrees/<change-name>` checkout.
2. Verify `git status --short` is clean or contains only intended final
   verification updates for that change.
3. Verify artifact completion and run
   `OPENSPEC_TELEMETRY=0 DO_NOT_TRACK=1 openspec validate <change-name>`.
4. Run required local push checks from the worktree:
   - `npm run test:types` is blocking.
   - `npm run lint` is blocking only when it exits non-zero.
   - `npm run format:check` is advisory unless it only reports selected-change
     drift that can be fixed safely.
5. If final verification changes intended selected-change files, commit those
   changes with a Conventional Commit. Do not create empty commits.
6. Run commitlint for any local commit that will be pushed.
7. Before pushing, inspect `.orchester/config.json` when it exists. If it
   contains `"enablePush": false`, stop and report that Orchester push safety is
   disabled. Do not push until a human enables it.
8. Verify repo-local Git identity is configured with `git config user.name` and
   `git config user.email`.
9. Push the selected branch to origin.

This worker MUST NOT run `openspec archive`. It also MUST NOT call `gh pr
create`, GitHub connector PR APIs, or any other manual PR creation path. If the
target repo has a branch-push workflow, that workflow owns pull request
creation after push.

After a successful push, keep the local `worktrees/<change-name>` worktree and
local branch intact. The pull request may still need conflict resolution,
follow-up fixes, or human review. Cleanup belongs to the archive phase after the
implementation has merged and the OpenSpec archive push has succeeded. Never
force-delete local branches from the ship worker.

If blocked, report the exact command and output. Keep any local commit intact so
a later run or human can resume.
